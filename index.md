## Alcohol gas sensor for breathalyzer

# Week 7
This week we had to have our PCB working and successfully booted up. Once booted it <br>
the sensors should be plugged in and working after running a program on the Raspberry Pi.<br>
All my sensors were successfully working, and my LED also flashed.<br>
<br>
There was a problem with my memory card at first with my Raspberry Pi,but after installing <br>
the latest version of Raspbian,everything was working fine.I ran the "i2cdetect -y 1" command,<br>
it showed the sensors being recognized.<br>
<br>
