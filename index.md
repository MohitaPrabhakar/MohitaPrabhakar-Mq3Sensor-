# Week 8
Since I am travelling next week I have 3 things due in week 8
I have built video due, the group placard and the 30 second script due in the week 8.
So Karandeep Singh and I are part of one group,We made the placard ,it somewhat looks like this.

# Week 6
Due to my travels plan in mid term of December ,I got a revised Schedule from Kristain for the hardware project.
In this week ,I showed my Alcohol Gas sensor (MQ3) Working .It displayed "Alcohol is detected" ,if alcohol was brought near the sensor.The results are refreshed after every second.
So this is the initial set up

 <br>
 After bringing the hand sanitizer near the sensor ,this is the output:-

 Hence the sensor works also,after the sanitizer is removed ,it displays "no alcohol detection after few seconds"

#  Week 5 - November 27 2017 
Due to strike, We didnt have to submit anything in the first week.
# Strike
 During the Strike,I got my parts within 2 weeks and I started working on setting up the Raspberry Pi and installing raspbian on it.
Also I did watch the Soldering tutorials online and sent the gerber files to Prototype lab department for printing the Board.

Once PCB board was made after 3 business days, I soldered it with the help of a technician and got the LED blinked

          

## PCB Soldered:

After the soldering,with the help of Vlad I got my LED blinked.
