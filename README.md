# Build Instructions For MQ3 SENSOR


### Introduction
The project aims to reduce accidents caused my impared driving.My sensor MQ3 provides analog resistive output based on Alcohol Concentration.The project was selected and the proposal was introduced.
MQ3 sensor or alcohol sensor is suitable for detecting alcohol concentration on breath, just like common breathalyzer
.It has a high sensitivity and fast response time. Sensor provides an analog resistive output based on alcohol concentration. 
This Sensor will be used with the app known as Breathalyzer which is made for personal use for self control or general health issues

### Budget 
The stuff required for creating the Breathalyzer can be seen below with the cost, which can be ordered from Amazon or Ebay.You may not be able to buy MQ3 SENSOR individually ,so you can order a set of MQx sensors which wouldnt cost more than $20 on amazon .

### Time Commitment
After selecting the project,make a schedule and act accordingly.It didnt take me much time to complete the project,because I was doing everything before time.If you dedicate 2-3 hours every week for the project ,you will be able to manage to finish the project on time.
After receiving the order,installing necessary stuff on the raspberry pi,it took 3-5 hours to set up the hardware,write a code and test the project.
