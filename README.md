# Build Instructions For MQ3 SENSOR


### Introduction
The project aims to reduce accidents caused my impared driving.My sensor MQ3 provides analog resistive output based on Alcohol Concentration.The project was selected and the proposal was introduced.
MQ3 sensor or alcohol sensor is suitable for detecting alcohol concentration on breath, just like common breathalyzer
.It has a high sensitivity and fast response time. Sensor provides an analog resistive output based on alcohol concentration. 
This Sensor will be used with the app known as Breathalyzer which is made for personal use for self control or general health issues
